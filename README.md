# Telecom-operator-TeleDom-  

The telecom operator TeleDom is faced with the problem of increasing customer churn, and to solve this problem it is necessary to develop an effective forecasting model that will help predict whether a subscriber will terminate the contract with  
 the operator. The project involves analyzing customer data, their contracts and services, as well as training a model that can predict customer churn.
